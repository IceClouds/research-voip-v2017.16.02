#
# LWINS configuration
#
# All options can be passed to the command line:
#
# Example:
#   --nbns-bind all
#
# To load a configuration file, pass the following option:
#   --config lwins.conf
#

#
# nbns-bind
# Defines on which IPs the NBNS service should listen.
# Set to "all" or "*" to listen on all IPs, or specify a list of
# IPs to listen on. An empty list disables the service.
# The default value is "all".
#
nbns-bind all

#
# nbns-database-file
# Defines a file to which the NBNS service should write it's database.
# This file will be written when the service gracefully terminates, and
# optionally in intervals as configured with the nbns-database-save-interval
# option. This file is read (if it exists) when the NBNS service starts
# up to restore its database. If this value is not set no database file will 
# be read or written, which means that the NBNS service loses its database
# when the service is restarted.
# The default value is "/tmp/lwins.db".
#
nbns-database-file /tmp/lwins.db

#
# nbns-database-save-interval
# Defines the interval in seconds how often the NBNS service should write
# its internal database to the file configured with the nbns-database-file
# option. This option is ignored if no file is configured. If this value
# is set to 0 and a database file is configured, then the database is only
# written when the NBNS service is terminated gracefully.
# The default value is 0.
#
nbns-database-save-interval 0

#
# replication-bind
# Defines which IP addresses the replication service should listen on.
# Set to "all" or "*" to listen on all IPs, or specify a list of IPs
# to listen on. This list can be empty.
# The default value is "all".
#
replication-bind all

#
# replication-port
# Defines on which TCP port the replication service should listen.
# The default value is 42.
#
replication-port 42

#
# replication-partners
# Defines a list of IP4 addresses of replication partners. An empty list means
# that replication from no partner is accepted. A value of "all" or "*" means
# that any partner is accepted.
# The default value is "all".
#
replication-partners all

#
# replication-auto-discovery
# Defines whether the replication service sends discovery packets. "on" turns
# auto-discovery on, and "off" turns it off.
# The default value is "on".
#
replication-auto-discovery on

#
# replication-auto-discovery-interval
# Defines the interval in minutes that the server should announce that it is
# operational. This option is ignored if option replication-auto-discovery
# is set to "off". If this option is not set the server will only send an
# auto-discovery notification during startup and shutdown.
# The default value is 10.
#
replication-auto-discovery-interval 10

#
# replication-packet-size-max
# Defines the maximum size of replication packets in kilobytes. If the value
# is set to 0, any size is allowed.
# The default value is 4096.
#
replication-packet-size-max 4096

#
# replication-pull-verify-max
# Defines the maximum number of records to verify during a pull-replication.
# If this value is set to 0, any number is allowed.
# The default value is 30000.
#
replication-pull-verify-max 30000

#
# user
# Defines the user name or id that will be used after the process initialized.
# This option should be used to drop the process' permissions. If the value is
# not set the process will run with the same permissions as it was started.
# If the option nbns-database-file is configured, read and write access to
# that file must be possible for this user/group.
# By default this option is not set.
#
user nobody

#
# group
# Defines the group name or id that will be used after the process initialized.
# This option should be used to drop the process' permissions. If the value is
# not set the process will run with the same permissions as it was started.
# If the option nbns-database-file is configured, read and write access to
# that file must be possible for this user/group.
# By default this option is not set.
#
group nogroup

#
# controlsocket
# Defines the path of the control socket to be used.  This allows using the
# administrative commands while LWINS is running.  If no path is not set,
# no control socket will be created.
# By default this option is not set.
#
controlsocket /var/run/lwins.ctl
